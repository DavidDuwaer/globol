* Dates, times, timestamps, time zones, durations.
* Conversion between them and calculations with them.
* **Type safe**. You want to express an moment in time, a date on a calendar, a time on the clock? If one the last two, in which time zone, or none at all? No longer will these nuances overwhelm or confuse. It turns out it is very easy, we just needed the right API.
* **Immutable**.
* **Fail early**. No `NaN`s sneaking into your date objects or anything like that. Globol checks its input, and throws errors with helpful messages if there's something wrong.
* **Fluent**. No searching the web for which functions suit your needs, but finding what you need with auto-complete.
* **In-place documentation**. Help yourself without leaving your IDE, with extensive JSDoc on all methods and functions.
* ISO-8601-compliant serilization/deserialization of all data representations.
* Under the hood, currently uses the **well-tested**, **well-trusted** `moment.js` internally for parsing, formatting and time zone conversions.
* **Uses moment-timezone** for time zone information. Future work is to make this optionally injectable, so `globol` can be smaller for users that need it to be.

Example:

```javascript
const timeInNewYork = now()     // returns an Instant in time (â‰¡ a timestamp)
    .atZone('America/New_York') // returns that Instant expressed in a certain time zone; a ZonedDateTime
    .toLocalTime();             // returns a time on the clock without a date, a LocalTime
```


# Install

```typescript
npm install globol
```

# How to use
Get the current timestamp
```typescript
import {Instant} from 'globol';

Instant.now()                // returns an Instant
```
All types and functions are in the `globol` module, so we'll leave the import statement out from now.
You can also use a shorthand for the current time:

```typescript
now()                        // returns an Instant
```

Get "tomorrow, in this timezone"
```typescript
const tomorrow = now()          // returns an Instant
    .atZone(TimeZone.browser()) // returns a ZonedDateTime
    .toLocalDate()              // returns a LocalDate (dropped the zone and the time)
    .plus({days: 1});
```

Get the current time on the clock (e.g. '14:57') in Berlin
```typescript
now()                        // a timestamp
    .atZone('Europe/Berlin') // returns a ZonedDateTime: the timestamp represented in this zone
    .toLocalTime()           // returns a LocalTime, e.g. '14:57'
```
This library consists mainly of a few smart data types that each describe a different concept of time.
This is what they are and how they relate to eachother:

</p>
<br/>

You can create instances of any one of them with static methods from their classes, e.g. `Instant.from(...)`,
`Instant.parse(...)` or `LocalTime.browser()`.
Similar methods exist on all Globol data types.
Once a data type is instantiated, there are methods for converting between them and doing calculations and
comparisons with them.

Below is a dedicated description for each data type.

### Instant
This is a moment in time, a timestamp. Is equivalent to a number of (milli)seconds since the epoch.
### ZonedDateTime
A date with a time and a time zone offset, e.g. `2020-01-20T19:34Z+01`. A `ZonedDateTime` implies one `Instant`, but one `Instant` can be represented in at least 24 ZonedDateTimes (one for each time zone).
### LocalDateTime
A date and a time together, but without a zone, e.g. `2020-01-20T19:34`
### LocalDate
A date without a time, e.g. `2020-01-20`
### LocalTime
A time without a date, e.g. one LocalTime can mean `18:34` or `6:34 PM`, depending on how you format it in string form.
### Duration
A fixed length of physical time.
### ZoneId & ZoneOffset
These represent timezones. The difference between ZoneId and ZoneOffset is as follows: ZoneId represents something like `Europe/Amsterdam`, which can have a `ZoneOffset` of +1 in the winter and +2 in the summer.

# Future work
## Time zone information
Browsers provide time zone information, but the support is still limited/incomplete. Therefore we'd like to make it optional to include the moment-timezone dependency. This can be done by make a separate NPM dependency called `globol-timezone` which, when included, runtime-enriches Globol with the `moment-timezone` time zone information. When it's left out globol would rely on the time zone information supplied by the browser.

# Feedback

If something is missing from this library that makes it not fit your use case today, or if you find a bug that spoils
it for you, don't hesitate to create an Issue (just a stub is better than nothing!) or a Pull Request. At this moment, the library is not at 1.0 yet and is organically growing to suit the use cases we run into first! Any feedback and/or contribution is sincerely appreciated.
